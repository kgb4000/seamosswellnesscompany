                I've been using sea moss in my diet for a few weeks now, and I'm
                genuinely impressed with the quality of this product. I've used
                it in my morning smoothies, and I feel more energized throughout
                the day. Highly recommend this to anyone looking for a natural
                health boost!

                I purchased gold sea moss on a friend's recommendation to help
                with my digestive issues. It's easy to prepare, and I love how
                it blends into my soups and sauces without changing the flavor.
                I'm giving it four stars only because the ocean smell was a bit
                strong when I first opened it, but it rinsed out easily.

                I'm always on the lookout for natural skincare products, and
                Golden Sea Moss has been a fantastic discovery. I've used it as
                a face mask, and my skin feels rejuvenated and hydrated. The
                fact that it's packed with minerals and vitamins is a huge plus
                for me. Also, experimenting with it in my vegan recipes has been
                fun. It's a five-star product for me!

                  <h3>Supports Thyroid Function:</h3>
                  <p>
                    Due to its high iodine content, golden sea moss can support
                    thyroid health. The thyroid gland needs iodine to produce
                    hormones that regulate metabolism, energy, and mood.

            How To Use Gold Sea Moss To Make Sea Moss Gel

          <div className="flex">
            <div className="howtousebg">
              <h3>#1. Clean the Sea Moss</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  You'll need golden sea moss, a large bowl, and fresh water
                  (preferably spring or distilled water).
                </li>
                <li>
                  Place the sea moss in a large bowl. Run cold water over it to
                  remove any sea debris, sand, or salt.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Carefully check the sea moss for any remaining debris. Rinse
                  several times until the water runs clear.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </div>
            <div className="howtousebg">
              <h3>#2. Soak the Sea Moss</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  After rinsing, cover the sea moss with a generous amount of
                  water, as it will expand during soaking.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Leave the sea moss to soak for at least 12 hours, or ideally,
                  24 hours. The moss will absorb water and double in size.
                </li>
                <li>
                  For added flavor and nutrients, consider adding a slice of
                  lime or lemon to the soaking water.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </div>
            <div className="howtousebg">
              <h3>#3. Blend the Sea Moss</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  After soaking, drain off the water and give the sea moss
                  another rinse.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Place the sea moss in a blender. Add fresh, clean water -
                  about 1 cup of water for every ounce of sea moss.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Blend until smooth. The mixture should form a thick, creamy
                  gel.

              <h3>Where does your golden sea moss come from?</h3>
              <p>
                Our raw golden sea moss is sustainably harvested from the
                pristine waters of St. Lucia in the Caribbean.
              </p>
              <h3>
                How should I store the raw golden sea moss after receiving it?
              </h3>
              <p>
                Store your gold sea moss in a cool, dry place away from direct
                sunlight. If refrigerated in an airtight container, it can last
                longer while maintaining its freshness and nutrient value.
              </p>
              <h3>Is your sea moss ethically sourced?</h3>

                Yes, our commitment to sustainability means our golden sea moss
                is ethically and sustainably sourced, respecting both the
                environment and local communities

              <h3>Will the sea moss have a strong ocean smell?</h3>
              <p>
                Raw sea moss has a natural ocean aroma, which is a sign of its
                purity. However, this scent diminishes significantly once it's
                rinsed and prepared.
              </p>
              <h3>Why does the sea moss have a dried salt coating?</h3>
              <p>
                The sea salt is occurs naturally and is simpley dried saltwater.
                It's a result of drying the sea moss which is dried in a dark
                room to preserve the green color. The salt also helps preserve
                the sea moss.
              </p>

                How does green sea moss differ from other types of sea moss?
              </h3>
              <p>
                The green variety is particularly noted for its high chlorophyll
                content, which may offer additional health benefits compared to

                daily. However, it's best to consult with a healthcare
                professional for personalized advice.

                Is your golden sea moss suitable for people with allergies?
              </h3>
              <p>
                Our golden sea moss is a natural product, but as with any
                sea-based item, it can cause reactions in individuals with
                certain allergies, particularly shellfish or iodine allergies.
                We recommend consulting with a healthcare professional if you
                have concerns.

              </p>
              <p>
                The thyroid gland uses iodine to produce thyroid hormones
                essential for regulating metabolism, body temperature, and
                energy production.
              </p>
              <p>
                These hormones are also vital for proper brain development
                during pregnancy and infancy, making adequate iodine intake
                essential for expecting mothers and young children.
              </p>
              <p>
                Iodine's role in thyroid function extends to maintaining healthy
                skin, hair, and nails, as thyroid hormones influence the growth
                and repair of these tissues.
              </p>
              <p>
                Additionally, balanced thyroid function, supported by sufficient
                iodine, is critical in preventing conditions like goiter
                (thyroid gland enlargement) and hypothyroidism (underactive
                thyroid), which can lead to fatigue, weight gain, and other
                health issues.
              </p>
              <p>
                As a natural source of iodine, sea moss can be particularly
                beneficial in supporting thyroid health and overall well-being.
              </p>
              <p>
                Its iodine content helps maintain the body's metabolic rate,
                ensuring efficient energy utilization and aiding in losing
                weight.
              </p>
              <p>
                Furthermore, for individuals following vegetarian or vegan
                diets, which might lack adequate iodine sources, incorporating
                sea moss can effectively supplement this essential mineral.
              </p>
              <p>
                However, consuming iodine in moderation is crucial, as both
                deficiency and excess can lead to thyroid problems.
              </p>
              <p>
                Excessive iodine intake, for example, can cause hyperthyroidism
                (overactive thyroid) or worsen existing thyroid conditions.
